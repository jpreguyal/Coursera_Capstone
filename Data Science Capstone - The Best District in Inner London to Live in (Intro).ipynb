Probably because you're a big football fan and there are many teams in the city to follow. However, that's only the choice you've made so far and you're not sure which district is best suited to your needs and other specifications. Such can be proximity to necessities, whether or not the place is a hot spot for crimes, or maybe the general atmosphere of the area. Of course, there can be many specifications but, in this project, we consider only these factors to determine the ideal place for you. \n",

Moreover, personal taste comes into play. What would be the ideal atmosphere of the place you live in? Do you want to live in a hotspot for coffee shops, restaurants, bars, or recreation? All of these questions can be answered by venue data we can attain from Foursquare API. This will be done later once we've analysed the crime data and have filtered down viable districts."
